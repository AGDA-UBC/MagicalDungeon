This is an AGDA 2018 project

We are making a PC dungeon crawler taking inspiration from boxhead and 
Starcraft use map settings special elite forces, but with a magical theme. 

The MVP would be to create the base mechanics of shooting AI enemies, and being
able to survive for long periods of time, with 3 different magical abilities.

stretch goal is to be able to level up and have a bigger map to explore.
